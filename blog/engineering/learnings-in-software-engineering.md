# Learnings in Software Engineering

I have been writing software used my many million users daily, for last 5 years now.  
I like the dynamics this field brings to the world. Your understanding of all sort of things keeps growing like forever.

## I have tried to summarise my understandings here -

* Software is eating the world, Internet is eating the software, JavaScript rules over Internet.
* It's easy to learn any software if you have the intention to learn it.
* If you are looking for quick solution, don't blame softwares and machines. Your mediocrity is no match to computer's dumbness.
* Most of the companies would never reach to the edge of the language/tool. Most companies don't need to bother much about the selection of Language. However, certain software programming languages are easy to learn and grasp. It will always be easy to hire talent with these skills.
* Designing require lots of thinking, Architecting require lots of planning. Coding is usually the easiest part.
* A little knowledge of OS, Terminal, GIT, SSH, Network always comes handy. [The Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is a great filler.
