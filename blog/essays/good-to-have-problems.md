# Good to have Problems

A friend of mine recently discovered that Expense ratio of a Mutual Fund eats up a good chunck of your money.  
It's good to make a big profit and give a fraction of it to the ones who enabled you to do it in first place, rather than putting that money aside and seeing it decay.

Those who know they can't buy an Audi are usually the ones complaining about maintaining budget of these cars. Their prime concern would be that parking isn't available easily, road-taxes are expensive.

I think it's graceful to accept something is not under one's ambitions or scope as of now, than nit-picking some odd issue about it.  
Those who keep pets know that the pet's care takes a toll on one's schedules, and that it's a big investment, both mentally and financially. But people still keep pets. It's good to have. You know the worth of a pet only when you have one (or you had one in past). Justifying that one is saving a good fortune by not having pet isn't gonna get you anywhere.

Sometimes, you gotta spend a few more dollars, invest some time in some good to have problems so that when you have a larger prospective (which short-sighted people usually can't see), you will know what made you accomplish it.  
[Reliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries) ain't such a giant in industries by saving and not spending on employees, but by investing more in whatever way they could. They build entire Jamnagar township. [Tata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group) went a step ahead and took so many bullets for their employees, and as a result, they are one of the most respected brand worldwide.
