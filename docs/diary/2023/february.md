The idea that a consolidated platform for couples seems promising.

Having worked with many senior colleagues, I know this as a matter of fact that they are always looking for different type of experiences. They have explored the "best restaurants for couples" or "best places for dinner date", and they are quite frustated even with the thought of having to make a search and go through a never ending list of suggestions which are not customised to tailor their needs, even though when the search platforms know so much about them.

#### This week, I watched -
* [Don't listen to the customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OARVjXqBI2A)  
Something that Steve Jobs has repeatedly told at many events.
* [Wei Dang - Launching and Growing a startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtPS97pFR40)  
I went through few other resources that described the culture at [Clipboard Health](https://www.clipboardhealth.com/). I am amazed by [Wei Dang](https://twitter.com/gabaluschi)

The shop's presently playing -  
"अपनी शामों में हिस्सा फिर किसी को न दिया  
इश्क तेरे बिना भी मैंने तुझसे ही किया"  

Having reached out to friends and LinkedIn connections, I could achieve few sign-ups and bookings for [Twople](https://twople.in)  
The initial leads we have looks good enough to go through customer research and VoC. Having read the feasibility of the market that we are trying to target via [Twople](https://twople.in), we will put our efforts more in enhancing the experience we provide to couples.  
The following week and rest of feb will see a web presence for [Twople](https://twople.in) as well.

#### This week, I watched -  
* [Some chess tips to improve if you are under 1400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRscRsIHRGI)  
I am at around 1000 now. Gotta work a lot on my moves.
* [React.js - The Documentary by HoneyPot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pDqJVdNa44)

* [How Finance Works - The HBR Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RxBbls_81U)  
[HBR](https://hbr.org/) has tons to offer to learn. I have always dreamed of experiencing life at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) someday.
