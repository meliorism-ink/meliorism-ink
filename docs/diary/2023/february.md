The idea that a consolidated platform for couples seems promising.

Having worked with many senior colleagues, I know this as a matter of fact that they are always looking for different type of experiences. They have explored the "best restaurants for couples" or "best places for dinner date", and they are quite frustated even with the thought of having to make a search and go through a never ending list of suggestions which are not customised to tailor their needs, even though when the search platforms know so much about them.

The shop's presently playing -  
"अपनी शामों में हिस्सा फिर किसी को न दिया  
इश्क तेरे बिना भी मैंने तुझसे ही किया"  

Having reached out to friends and LinkedIn connections, I could achieve few sign-ups and bookings for [Twople](https://twople.in)  
The initial leads we have looks good enough to go through customer research and VoC. Having read the feasibility of the market that we are trying to target via [Twople](https://twople.in), we will put our efforts more in enhancing the experience we provide to couples.  
The following week and rest of feb will see a web presence for [Twople](https://twople.in) as well.

::: tip On Failures and Success in Entrepreneurship
The bad news is, you will fail a lot in your Entrepreneurship journey.  
The good news is, you need to succeed just once.
:::

What makes entrepreneurship tough, specially for first timers, is that one doesn't know what one doesn't know.
It's like [Shikamaru Nara](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Shikamaru_Nara) fighting the unknown [Akatsuki](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Akatsuki). It's one thing to fight a tough enemy, it's another to fight what's unknown.  
- What weapon will you bring in battle ? Which justu ??  
- How will you strategize ?? Wgat will be your course of action ??
- How will you evaluate or predict your chances of success ??
- Was it your battle to fight ??

Well, there's only one way to konw answers to these. And Shikamaru did the same. Try and get to know.
It took him twice to beat the Ataksuki.  
Chankaya didn't know how to beat Dhana Nanda's army. It took them numerous lost battles to overthrow and capture Magadh.

The answer lies in exploration and experimentation.

First time founders face the same difficulty.  
We don't know what is the next big idea, how to make the next billion dollar app.
What we have is the little experience we have gained through our hard work and learnings over years, and the will-power to cherish the unknown.


#### This week, I watched -  
* [Notion's story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPYl7nIKRbA)  
It took them almost a decade to become what Notion is today. 
* [Disrupting the World's largest assets class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA)  
A16Z is a well konwn name in Venture Capatalists. They have good confidence in Adam Neumann's latest company FLOW.
* [Carl Pei React's to MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBEB5nB64u8)  
The launch event by Nothing didn't have anything extraordinary. To the extent, that MKBHD comments that it was a event that could have been an email.  
Carl responds that they wanted to make some more announcements, which unfortunately were not ready by the deadlines. Anyway, it's better anyday to launch with some imperfectinos than to wait for all the stars to align.  
I guess MKBHD was having an expectation of a big corporate, whereas Carl's Nothing is just a startup as of now.
* [Difference between winning and succedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MM-psvqiG8)
A good take on who we should tone our mind to succeed and merely win.
