## Friday 13th

Left Quizizz with dreams to start my own company.

I feel I am quite ready to take this leap of faith for the first time.
Sound engineering knowledge to build, decent savings to help financially, good number of stories of entrepreneurs read and numerous interviews and other videos watched. What else should I be waiting for ?

What's going on in my mind -
* Sometimes, one should not think logically and do what the gut says.
* If you are doing something you don't like, you are gonna suck at it.

## Tuesday 30th

[Bellary](https://goo.gl/maps/M6ajd6eLLGikb4Lj6) trip was a good memoir.  
Divya has always been a caring and supportive friend. I have seen her growing from a shoe-stepper to a good data science student. I am sure she will establish herself as an even better professional.  
It was a spectacular wedding and I wish her a lifetime of love and happiness ahead. I wish her a good learning on her experiments with [Mitahara](https://mitahara.co/).

I watched a beautiful sunset at Bellary fort. [Her highness Princess Nidhi](https://twitter.com/Nidhi_vinaykiya) took us on a tour of her empire. [Food Bells](https://goo.gl/maps/NRU9GAAfZqh6gPki6) is a great place for hangout in Bellary.

Back to brainstorming on [Twople](https://twople.in)
