## Friday 13th

Left Quizizz with dreams to start my own company.

I feel I am quite ready to take this leap of faith for the first time.
Sound engineering knowledge to build, decent savings to help financially, good number of stories of entrepreneurs read and numerous interviews and other videos watched. What else should I be waiting for ?

What's going on in my mind -
* Sometimes, one should not think logically and do what the gut says.
* If you are doing something you don't like, you are gonna suck at it.
