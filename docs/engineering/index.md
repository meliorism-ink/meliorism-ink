# Engineering

Since I have been a developer for most of my professional career, I feel its easiest for me to write about Software Engineering.

I bring views mostly from a web-developer's perspective. Though I have a little experience of indulging in Open-Source software development by having contributed to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
