# Strong Opinions Weakly Held

## tldr

* Teens should have Weak Opinions and hold onto them very weakly.
* Youths (in 20s) will start to have strong opinions but again, they must hold them weakly.
* 30s or later is when one should start having strongly hold opinions.

While you are young, you haven't seen enough of the world to have understanding of many things that happened, is happening, or will happen.

You may think you know.

You have worked 6 months as an intern and 6 more months as a full-time employee at a video-streaming company (say something like [Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com)). You know how there systems are functioning together. You think you can do it too, all on your own.

Nah, you are wrong. Don't believe me ?? Try it. Take 21 days, 51 days, or whatever you need. I bet you won't.

Cause you are more exposed to the abstract product, abstract system which was meant for you. You don't know the inner details, the business understanding, the engineering efforts and the grounds on which decisions were taken. You won't understand why many parts of the system, still being inefficient individually, are sooooo meaningful for the whole.
What looks like a really bad implementation to you, might have been there to support something big.
